Requesting LCK standings from the bot

## What is it?
This little, interactive bot is written in **Discord.py**.

The bot used be hosted on Heroku and provide useful information about League of Legends pro games (mostly LCK), interact with the users, and provide the rarest memes, but this version is now discontinued and a new successor has taken the name, shape, etc... everything from this old version.

The bot did so by using [Selenium.py](https://www.selenium.dev/](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/), a powerful, automated web driver that's available for many languages. Now the code is archived only to be displayed to the public...

The new, lively version of the bot can be found [here](https://github.com/hiphophammer/Discord_Bot_v2).
